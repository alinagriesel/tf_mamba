# Motivating Implementation of Mamba Architecture
## Content
We have implemented a simple version of the Mamba model proposed in Gu and Dao's Paper "Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces". The idea was to 
## Repository Structure
The repository consists of this readme.md file, a requirements.txt to create an environment that will enable running the code, the project paper and two folders containing the experiments carried out with the implementation. The next_token folder contains two small experiments on next token prediction with Mamba using the bible as dataset. The sentiment folder contains two experiments performing a binary sentiment analysis with Mamba using movie reviews as training data.
